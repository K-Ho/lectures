# Chapter 3

## Outline
This chapter is intended to introduce students to Proof of Work, Nakamoto Consensus, and some basic tools for game 
theoretical analysis. Students already know exactly what decentralized consensus algorithms are solving, and so
now we can not only look at a solution but also analyze it's properties.

## Lectures

### 0: Overview

#### Outline
- Remind everyone what the problem we are trying to solve is (double spend, consensus in adversarial network)
- 1 minute explainer on proof of work as a mechanism
  - Simple animation showing nodes mining
- Transition to "the hard part": analysis
- Say that in order to analyze this we will first need to review some game thoery
- Mention some topics--nash equlibrium, strategy set, etc
- Analyze the selfish mining game
