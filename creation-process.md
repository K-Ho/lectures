# A (probably sub-optimal) Lecture Creation Process
Karl here--Before this repository, I have been creating these slides & videos by myself. I feel it could be useful for
me to document the process by which I create the lectures & slides.

### Software
I use Photoshop, Sketch, Final Cut, and Google Slides. (Guess what my OS is! Eek! SecOps fail! :P )

### Slide Creation & Animations
I use Google slides for all of my slides and I use zero fancy animation libraries or tools. Instead what I do is I create a slide with elements that I want to animate, and I simply duplicate that slide over and over, changing the position slightly.

#### Some handy tips when using Google Slides:
- Duplicate image: Option + click + drag will duplicate the image you clicked on.
- Send forward, backward, to front, to back: Click on an element you want to change the ordering of & click `cmd up/down` arrow to change the ordering. If you want to send to front or back, that's `cmd shift up/down`.
- Gray out elements: Create a white rectangle, change opacity, and have it cover what you're working on.

### Diagram Creation
This is by far the hardest part of creating lectures. To create the ultimate digram you really need to understand the essence of what you are explaining. One great example of this is the progression of my Plasma slides. You can see me explaining Plasma MVP vs my Devcon Plasma presentation. Notice just how much more detailed and clear my Devcon slides were because I better understood how to represent each concept in my head as well as on paper:

- Plasma MVP - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RzextrcF7LJFt9pGE-gEN3HyLFlQ_8kbl4nGAvsaAM4/edit?usp=sharing
- Plasma Devcon - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xg5czpi-4t7ritct2D8Fp2xDALSyrY_O8cWC8KKRfSo/edit?usp=sharing

### Recording
I use Quicktime to record both my screen & webcam at the same time. Then I splice them together in Final Cut. I have also used Zoom's share screen and record as a way to generate a video with both my screen & my face in the corner without any video editing software. Unfortuantely Zoom reduces quality so I prefer Quicktime.

I have [a nice little USB mic as well](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATR2100-USB-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B004QJOZS4) which I carry around on me in case I want to record.
